# Hello Friend:

My name is Mu, and I'm the author of this blog. I am not an expert in anything particular just documenting my journey through data science and the transition from a person who was a "doer"(in the biological sciences, a sad degree in microbiology and masters of public health, army reservist) to a "knower" in machine learning, data science, and cyber security. Wow, big shift in career fields, I can hear some of you say. However, you will see there are quite a few parallels in the fields as we travel down this road together.  

Well I digress, and I hope you will find this blogs/website (which are excellent in their own right) a little different from the coding websites that give you snippets of code without connecting the dots to the bigger picture. Because I am a visual thinker, I need to see everything in action to "get it". Code a little, debug a little. This my passion project, so if you find some error or just need to reach out STS, my email is shecodesinmysteriousways@gmail.com
